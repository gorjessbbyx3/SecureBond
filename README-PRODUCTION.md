# Production Deployment Guide

## Security Enhancements Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ Role-based access control (RBAC)
- ✅ Session management with secure cookies
- ✅ Rate limiting on login endpoints
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Audit logging for all sensitive operations
- ✅ Enhanced error boundaries and graceful error handling

### Security Middleware
- ✅ Express rate limiting
- ✅ Security headers (OWASP recommendations)
- ✅ Input sanitization against XSS
- ✅ CSRF protection via SameSite cookies
- ✅ SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries

### Data Protection
- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt (12 rounds)
- ✅ Sensitive data access logging
- ✅ Data validation using Zod schemas
- ✅ Secure session storage

### Monitoring & Logging
- ✅ Comprehensive audit trail
- ✅ Security event logging
- ✅ Performance monitoring
- ✅ Error tracking and alerting
- ✅ System health monitoring

## Production Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Set SESSION_SECRET environment variable
- [ ] Configure database connection string
- [ ] Enable HTTPS/TLS certificates
- [ ] Set up reverse proxy (Nginx/Apache)
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Set up backup strategy
- [ ] Configure monitoring alerts

### Environment Variables
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
SESSION_SECRET=your-secure-random-session-secret
DATABASE_URL=your-production-database-url
PORT=5000
```

### Security Headers (handled by middleware)
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

### Performance Optimizations
- Gzip compression enabled
- Static asset caching
- Database connection pooling
- Query optimization
- Rate limiting for API protection

### Backup Strategy
- Automated daily database backups
- Log file rotation and archival
- Configuration file versioning
- Disaster recovery procedures

## Monitoring Endpoints

- `/api/system/health` - System health check
- `/api/dashboard/stats` - Application metrics
- Audit logs stored in `/logs` directory

## Default Credentials (CHANGE IN PRODUCTION)

**Admin Account:**
- Username: admin
- Password: admin123
- Email: admin@alohabailbond.com

**Maintenance Account:**
- Username: maintenance
- Password: maint123
- Email: maintenance@alohabailbond.com

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Change these credentials immediately after deployment!

## Security Best Practices

1. **Regular Updates**: Keep all dependencies updated
2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular security audits
3. **Access Reviews**: Periodic review of user permissions
4. **Backup Testing**: Regular backup restoration tests
5. **Incident Response**: Documented security incident procedures

## Support & Maintenance

- Regular security patches
- Performance monitoring
- Backup verification
- Log analysis
- System optimization

For production deployment assistance, ensure all security measures are properly configured and tested before going live.
